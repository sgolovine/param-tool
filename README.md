## Param Tool

A simple tool that creates a URL from query paramaters

### Motivation

Ever had to create a web-app that took in lots and lots of Query Paramaters like this?

```
https://mysite.com?foo=something&bar=something&baz=something&bat=something
```

If you have then you will know that it's an absolute pain in the a\*\* so modify these paramaters in the URL address bar. This tool helps with that, you can type in your base URL followed by as many query paramaters as you need. Then the app will form them into a URL that you can navigate to. This tool also persists your form data into your browser cookies so you can leave the site and return to it later while still keeping you query parmaters around.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node v11.5+ installed as well as `yarn`. To install dependencies just run `yarn` inside the project
